Engineering Graduates Employment Outcomes.

1.ABSTRACT
In excess of 10,00,000 specialists enter the worldwide labour force each year. An applicable inquiry is the thing that decides the positions and pay rates these specialists are offered just after graduation. Past investigations have indicated the impact of different factors, for example, school notoriety, reviews, the field one spends significant time in and economic situations for explicit ventures.

Human capital is a company’s most important asset. It is also typically the largest operating expense, and thus can have a major impact on profitability and overall success of a company. To keep employees engaged and productive, companies must compensate them appropriately, without overpaying them. The cost of overpaying or underpaying can make a significant impact on a company’s business.  Accurate recruitment of employees is a key element in the business strategy of every company due to its impact on companies’ productivity and competitiveness.
In this project we depict the subtleties of the dataset and talk about a range of inquiries around meritocracy in labour markets, predispositions in labour determination and other common market influences it can help reveal and answer.

4.	INTRODUCTION
The new economic policies introduced in the early 1990s enhanced foreign investment portfolios into the domestic Indian Market. Since then, the increasing globalization has integrated Indian labour markets to global markets. Indian labour markets have seen a tremendous growth in the last two decades in the private sector. India, with one of the fastest growing economies in the world, also has one of the largest Information Technology (IT) industries in the world, hence generating a huge demand for skilled labour. 

Every year a massive number of engineers are entering into Indian Markets. In recent times, the rapidly emerging economy and increasing technology sector have a significant impact on demand and supply for specific skills, practices, and employability of engineers. Even though this demand is diversified across industrial sectors, a large number of these engineers are employed within the IT sector. In recent years the supply of engineers has surpassed the demand in the Indian IT sectors. Recent survey studies have indicated that this quantity surge has also degraded the quality and employability of engineering graduates. Salary is considered one of the major reasons for pursuing engineering as college studies. The aim of this study is to determine the various factors that determine the salaries of engineering graduates in Indian Labour Markets.

Undergraduate Students make numerous decisions during their academic years which influence the course of their career. There are a number of factors which are in play such as choice of university, study majors, internships etc. and which may have a significant impact on the salaries and career options. This research study will focus on determining the impact of academic performance, cognitive skills, personality traits, standardized test scores and demographics on the starting salaries of undergraduate students specific to Indian Labour Markets.

For Engineering Studies - the student generally joins an engineering college through an entrance exam or merit-based criteria depending on the type of college, which then in turn has an affiliation to one of the Central, State or Deemed Universities. The curriculum and structure of study again differ depending on the universities. These diversities in education ecosystem make it difficult for the employer to evaluate students based on standard merit. So, in order to standardize the evaluation criteria more than 3500 organizations refers to AMCAT (Aspiring Minds) scores – A standardized test students take after the undergraduate course. The dataset used for this study is released by Aspiring Minds, the organization which facilitates this test. 

Research Project: The main purpose of the research study is to examine the academic factors, cognitive skills and personality factors, which best predicts the salary of a recently graduated engineer in Indian Markets. The sample of study focuses on engineering graduates in India. Within this study, independent variables will include: Personal Information, Pre-University Information, Standardized Test Scores and Demographics Information of candidates. The dependent variables in the dataset are Starting Salary, Job location, and Job Title. Regression analysis will be performed to study the relationship between these variables. The study also performs a comparative analysis of various salary prediction models based on prediction accuracy to find an optimal salary predictor. 

The study aims to answer the following Research Question: What are the primary factors, in determining the starting salary of a recently graduated engineer in Indian Labour Markets? The results of the study would allow an engineering graduate to best navigate through various choices to achieve higher salaries. The results will also help the leaders in the education system to develop programs and resources to align with the requirements of higher wages into the Indian Labour Markets. The outcomes of the study can significantly inform the students and education administrators in terms of choices and focus on achieving a higher return for both parties. 

Research Objectives and Hypotheses: In order to answer the research question, a quantitative study will be conducted using the AMEO dataset. The research objectives of the research study are:
•	To explore the existing knowledge base by measuring or evaluating the employability and salary dynamics of undergraduate and graduate students. 
•	To understand the impact of different factors such as cognitive skills, academic choices, academic performance, demographics, and personality traits on the salary of fresh engineering graduates. 
•	To examine which of the cognitive skills is contributing the most to Salary. 
•	To build and select the best classification model evaluated on the basis of Accuracy and ROC_AUC as the performance measuring evaluation, in classifying the salary of recent engineering graduates. 

In addition, there are a few hypotheses which are established from the general understanding of the Indian education systems and Indian labour markets. These hypotheses will be tested under the research study. The following hypotheses are:
•	H1: Is there a difference in Mean Salaries with respect to Gender? 
•	H2: Are engineering graduates from Tier A colleges paid higher starting salaries than the graduates from Tier B college?
•	H3: Is there a difference in Mean Salaries with respect to 12th Board? 
•	H4: Are Frequencies for Males and Females distributions equal with respect to Salary Class?
•	H5: Is English is the strongest predictor of salary compared to Logical and Quantitative ability? 





Research Methodology: An exploratory research method is used to address the research question using secondary data. A quantitative research approach is used to conduct an investigation into the data to understand the quantitative properties and underlying relationships within the data. The research objectives defined earlier will be achieved using the course of action outlined below: 
•	An extensive literature review is conducted, which is used to summarize the existing research studies in the context to the research question. Additionally, the literature review will allow to objectively shape the course of the research project.
•	The relationships between the various factors on determining the starting salary are explored using various visualizations and feature engineering combined with data preprocessing.
•	Statistical tests are used for hypothesis testing 
•	Classification modelling with various techniques is used to build an accurate class predictor and the best performing model is selected using model accuracy based on Accuracy and ROC_AUC scores.
•	Unsupervised Learning is applied on the dataset for exploration purposes to check classification model accuracies built on labels generated by unsupervised models.


Scope and Limitations: The scope of the research study is targeted on recently graduated engineers within Indian Labour Markets. There is a significant amount of research literature available that is focused on examining the various factors that predict job seeking behavior and re-employment of experienced professionals. This study will not focus on experienced professionals but rather on newly graduated engineers. The study is concentrated around the first job placement of engineering students after graduation and not the successive job offers. 

5.	PROBLEM STATEMENT

More than a million engineers enter the global workforce every year. A relevant question is what determines the jobs and salaries these engineers are offered right after graduation. Various factors such as college grades, candidate skills, proximity of the college to industrial hubs, the specialization one has, market conditions for specific industries determine this. Based on this information, our group has derived two problem statements, which we aim to address in this project:
1.The factors that influence the salary and job titles of engineering graduates in the labour market.
2.Machine learning models to predict the class of salary of engineering graduates based on the relevant factors.
